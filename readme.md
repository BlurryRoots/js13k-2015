## Getting started

### On *nix systems

Change directory into project.
To build the project run: ```npm install && make```
This will build a single html under build/index.html.
To run the application open build/index.html or execute ```make run``` which will open build/index.html in your standard browser.

### On windows systems

In order to build the project you would need to install a port of gnu make, or run the commands found in ```makefile``` manually.
